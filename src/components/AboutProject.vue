    <h2>Tools/Frameworks</h2>
    <p>
        To create this website we used a few tools to make development smoother.
        These tools included frameworks like Foundation for CSS and Vue.js to easily build the user interface and our single page web application.
    </p>
    <h4>Project 3 RESTful Server, Leaflet, and Nominatim API</h4>
    <p>
        We also used a couple APIs to gather, and visualize the St. Paul Crime Data.
        First, our data comes from a RESTful API that we built previously.
        To visualize the incident data we use the Leaflet API to easily visualize crime incidents on a map.
        And finally we used the Nominatim API which smoothly converts between address and latitude/longitude.
    </p>
    <h4>Vue.js</h4>
    <p>
        We used Vue.js framework to manage our front-end app structure and logic.
        Vue.js allowed us to manage and update app state efficiently through data binding and lifecycle hooks.
